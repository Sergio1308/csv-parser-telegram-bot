# Python "CSV Parser" Telegram Bot
This bot allows you to send a .csv file, the bot will parse it and write the received data to the database.

Each column in the file is written to a separate table.

Features:
* This bot can parse any number of columns in a csv file and create a table with the name that was entered in the first line (ex: .csv file contains names of the columns in the first line: users, date, mail. So, table names will have the same names).

Bot available [here](https://t.me/csv_parser_bot), or type @csv_parser_bot in the search field.
